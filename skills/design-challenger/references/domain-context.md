# Domain Notes (Generic)

Use this only when domain context is necessary and no project-specific docs exist.
Keep guidance high-level and avoid vendor-specific patterns.

- Identify the system boundary and primary trust boundaries.
- Clarify upgrade and governance assumptions if changes are long-lived.
- Note any hard requirements around backward compatibility or determinism.
- Prefer minimal protocols over feature-rich ones unless requirements demand it.
